Ingredients:
	2 1/2 cups (375g) self-raising flour, sifted
	1 teaspoon baking powder
	1 cup (220g) caster sugar
	1/2 cup (125ml) vegetable oil
	1 egg
	1/2 cup (125ml) milk
	1 teaspoon vanilla extract
	300 g fresh or frozen blueberries
	granulated sugar, for sprinkling

Instructions:
	Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F).
	Place the flour, baking powder and sugar in a bowl. Place the oil, egg, milk and vanilla in a separate bowl and whisk to combine.
	Pour the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Add the blueberries and mix to combine.
	Spoon mixture into a 12-hole ½-cup capacity (125ml) muffin tin lined with paper patty cases. Sprinkle the tops with sugar and bake for 30–35 minutes or until cooked when tested with a skewer. Remove from tin and cool on a wire rack.
	Comments said 20 min baking time enough and need more milk

Notes: Many comments of not enough milk, some say too many blue berries and some say can taste the baking powder and many said baking time of 20min to be enough.
