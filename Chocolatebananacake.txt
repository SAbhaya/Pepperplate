Ingredients:
	3 ripe bananas, mashed
	185 g (6 1/2 oz/3/4 cup) caster (superfine) sugar
	185 g (6 1/2 oz/1 1/2 cups) self-raising flour
	2 eggs, lightly beaten
	3 tablespoons light olive oil
	3 tablespoons milk
	100 g (3 1/2 oz) dark chocolate, roughly chopped
	90 g (3 1/4 oz/3/4 cup) walnuts, chopped

Instructions:
	Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/Gas 4). Lightly grease a 10 × 20 cm (4 × 8 inch) loaf (bar) tin and line the base with baking paper.
	Mix the banana and sugar in a large bowl. Add the sifted flour, eggs, oil and milk. Stir the mixture gently for 30 seconds. Fold in the chocolate and walnuts.
	Pour the mixture into the tin and bake for 55 minutes, or until lightly browned. Leave to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack. Serve with cream, if you like.
