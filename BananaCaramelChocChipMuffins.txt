Ingredients:
	1 cup self-raising flour
	3/4 cup plain flour
	1/4 cup caster sugar
	60 g butter, melted, cooled
	1 cup milk
	1 egg, lightly beaten
	1 teaspoon vanilla essence
	1 cup mashed banana
	1/3 cup caramel bits

Instructions:
	Preheat oven to 190°C/170°C fan-forced. Line a 12 hole, 1/3 cup-capacity muffin pan with paper cases.
	Combine flours and sugar in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre. Add butter, milk, egg and vanilla. Mix until just combined. Fold in banana and caramel bits.
	Spoon mixture evenly between paper cases. Bake for 20 to 22 minutes or until golden and just firm to touch. Stand in pan for 5 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Serve.

Notes: Here's a tip: Don't overmix muffin batter as your muffins will come out tough.
