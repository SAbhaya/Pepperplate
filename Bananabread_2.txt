Ingredients:
	olive oil
	250 g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting
	3 ripe bananas
	2 tablespoons fresh apple juice
	125 g unsalted butter
	2 large free-range eggs
	1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
	2 tablespoons runny honey
	Optional:
	50 g pecans

Instructions:
	Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4.
	Lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 1-litre loaf tin with olive oil.
	Dust the sides of the tin lightly with flour, then tap to get rid of any excess.
	Peel and add the bananas to a mixing bowl.
	Using a fork, mash the bananas so you've got a mixture of smooth and chunky, then put aside.
	Add the apple juice and stir to combine.
	In a separate bowl, beat the butter with a wooden spoon until creamy.
	Crack in the eggs one at a time, beating each one in well before adding the next.
	Fold in the flour, cinnamon, honey and banana mixture, taking care not to over mix.
	Roughly chop the pecans on a chopping board, if using, then fold through the mixture.
	Spoon into the loaf tin, then bake in the hot oven for around 40 minutes, or until golden and cooked through.
	To check if it's done, stick a cocktail stick or skewer into the middle of the loaf, remove it after 5 seconds and if it comes out clean the loaf's cooked; if it's slightly sticky it needs a bit longer.
	Allow the loaf to cool slightly, then carefully turn out on to a wire rack to cool completely.
	Transfer to a nice plate, cut into slices, then serve.
