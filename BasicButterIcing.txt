Ingredients:
	250 g unsalted butter, at room temperature, chopped
	3 cups pure icing sugar, sifted
	1 to 2 tablespoons milk

Instructions:
	Using an electric mixer, beat butter until white and creamy. Add icing sugar, 1/2 cup at a time, and mix well. Add enough milk to make icing spreadable.
	Cover surface of the icing with plastic wrap to prevent it drying out while you finish preparing cakes.

Notes: Variation 1 - orange butter icing: Add 1 tbs finely grated orange rind with the butter.
Variation 2 - coffee butter icing: Dissolve 2 tbs instant coffee granules in the milk.
Variation 3 - chocolate butter icing: Reduce the icing sugar to 230g (1 1/2 cups). Omit the milk. Stir in 250g melted, cooled, good-quality dark chocolate.
Variation 4 - dark chocolate butter icing: Reduce the icing sugar to 300g (2 cups). Omit the milk. Sift in 2 tbs cocoa powder and then stir in 600g melted, cooled, good-quality dark chocolate.

Make sure you beat the butter well to begin with.
