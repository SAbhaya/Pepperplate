Ingredients:
	1 cup self-raising flour
	1 cup semi-skimmed milk
	1 free-range egg
	1 pinch sea salt
	1 pear
	a few knobs butter
	fat-free natural yoghurt, to serve
	runny honey, to serve

Instructions:
	Put the flour, milk, egg and salt in a mixing bowl and whisk until smooth. Once combined, grate in the pear, core and all then stir it through with a spoon.
	Put a large pan on a medium heat and add a knob of butter. Once that melts, add the batter, a spoonful at a time to the hot pan. You'll need to cook them in batches, cooking them for a few minutes until golden on the bottom, then flipping over and cooking for a few minutes more until they're done.
	When they are golden and fluffy, serve them right away with a dollop of natural yoghurt and some runny honey drizzled all over the top.
	Tip: If you sweeten the batter, thicken it with just a little more flour then pour them into a Yorkshire pudding or muffin tin as they also make the most delicious muffins.

Notes: You can have fun with it by switching up the fruit; strawberries, apples, blackberries, blueberries and bananas are all delicious in these pancakes so feel free to swap out the pears for any of those. The batter will keep as good as gold in the fridge for a day or two if you have any left over.
