Ingredients:
	1 cup grated tasty cheese
	1/2 cup marinated sun-dried tomatoes, drained, chopped
	1/2 teaspoon salt

[Basic muffin mix]
	2 1/2 cups self-raising flour
	1 1/4 cups milk
	1 egg, lightly beaten
	90 g butter, melted

Instructions:
	Preheat oven to 180°C. Lightly grease a 12-hole, 1/3-cup capacity non-stick muffin pan.
	Make basic muffin mix: Sift flour into a large bowl. Add cheese, tomatoes and salt to flour and stir to combine. Make a well in the centre. Combine milk, egg and butter in a jug. Pour milk mixture into the well. Using a large metal spoon, stir until just combined (don’t over-mix).
	Spoon mixture into muffin holes until three-quarters full. Bake for 20 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Allow to cool in pan for 1 minute. Turn out onto a wire rack to cool. Serve.

Notes: Muffins freeze well in snap-lock bags, but are best eaten on the day they are made.
