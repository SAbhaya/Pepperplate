Ingredients:
	3/4 cup (165g) raw sugar
	175 ml sunflower oil
	3 eggs, lightly beaten
	1 large carrot (about 140g), grated
	100 g raisins
	Grated zest of 1 large orange
	175 g self-raising flour
	1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
	1 tsp ground cinnamon
	1/2 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
	1/3 cup (55g) icing sugar (to ice, optional)

Instructions:
	Preheat oven to 180Â°C. Grease and line the base and sides of a 28cm x 18cm slice pan.
	Use a wooden spoon to mix the sugar, oil and egg in a large bowl, then stir in the carrot, raisins and zest. Sift in flour, soda and spices. Stir to just combine, then pour into the pan. Bake for 20-25 minutes until a skewer inserted in centre comes out clean. Cool slightly, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
	If making icing, sift icing sugar into a bowl and stir with 1-2 teaspoons warm water to form a smooth, soft icing. Drizzle over slice with a teaspoon, then leave to set for 10 minutes. Alternatively, dust with 2 tbs sifted icing sugar. Cut into 12 bars.

Notes: Store for 2-3 days in an airtight container.
