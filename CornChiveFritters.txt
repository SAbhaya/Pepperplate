Ingredients:
	150 g (1 cup) self-raising flour
	1/2 tsp baking powder
	1 to 2 tsp lemon pepper seasoning
	1 egg
	250 ml (1 cup) buttermilk
	1 corn cob, kernels removed
	1/2 bunch fresh chives, chopped
	1/4 cup chopped fresh coriander
	Olive oil spray
	1 avocado, peeled, stone removed, coarsely chopped
	1 tbs fresh lime juice
	1 tsp finely grated lime rind
	Fresh coriander leaves, to serve

Instructions:
	Sift flour and baking powder into a bowl. Add seasoning. Make a well in the centre of the mix. Whisk in egg and buttermilk. Stir until just smooth. Fold in corn, chives and coriander.
	Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Spray with oil. Add tablespoonfuls of fritter mixture, allowing room for spreading. Cook fritters for 2-3 minutes or until bubbles appear. Turn fritters over and cook for another 1-2 minutes or until golden. Repeat with remaining mixture.
	Combine avocado, lime juice and lime rind in a bowl. Top fritters with coriander leaves and serve with lime and avocado.

Notes: 1. For light, fluffy fritters, fold in the corn, chives and coriander gently until the mixture is just combined.
2. Allow plenty of room between the spoonfuls of mixture in the pan – the fritters spread as they cook.
3. Once the fritters have bubbles on the surface and are golden underneath, they’re ready to turn.
