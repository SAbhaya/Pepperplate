Ingredients:
	2 cups (260g) self-raising flour
	1 tsp ground cinnamon
	1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda
	1 cup (100g) rolled oats
	1/2 cup (100g) brown sugar
	2 eggs
	3/4 cup (185g) plain low-fat yoghurt
	1/4 cup (60ml) canola oil
	2 bananas, mashed (250g)

Instructions:
	Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Line a 12 cup muffin pan with paper cases.
	Sift flour, cinnamon and soda into a bowl. Empty the flour husks from the sifter back into the bowl along with the oats and brown sugar, and stir to combine.
	Whisk eggs, yoghurt and oil together. Add banana and stir to combine. Pour into dry ingredients and mix together using a wooden spoon until just combined. Mixture may be lumpy and does not have to be evenly mixed.
	Spoon mixture into paper cases. Bake for 20 minutes or until golden and cooked through. Cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
